2. Wire up the generic login view with the specific type view for each entity
3. Build views for the profile/dashboard and the content upload view
4. Configure the package file to run the server before the client such that there is no neeed to
   explicitly start the nodemon ourselves on a separate template.
5. Set up a universal views directory or configure the server to know where to find its views.
6  Clean up the server to not render its own views but trigger requests for the already built ones on
   successful requests.
